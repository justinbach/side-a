# Claude Code Workflow Instructions

## Git
- Work on short-lived feature branches, not directly on main.
- Branch naming: `feature/<short-description>` (e.g. `feature/auth-setup`, `feature/play-logging`)
- Commit frequently with clear, concise commit messages.
- Open a PR to main when the feature is complete. Do not merge — leave that to me.

## General
- Read CONTEXT.md in this directory before starting any work.
- Ask before making decisions that would deviate from the architecture or build order in CONTEXT.md.
