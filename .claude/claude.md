# Claude Code Workflow Instructions

## Git
- Work on short-lived feature branches, not directly on main.
- Branch naming: `feature/<short-description>` (e.g. `feature/auth-setup`, `feature/play-logging`)
- Commit frequently with clear, concise commit messages.
- Open a PR to main when the feature is complete. Do not merge — leave that to me.

## General
- Read CONTEXT.md in this directory for project architecture and design principles.
- Check /BACKLOG.md (in project root) for current priorities and planned work.
- Update BACKLOG.md as you complete tasks or identify new work.
- Ask before making significant architectural changes.
